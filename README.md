- This project is a simple search engine that uses the Google Web Search API to fetch search results and display them to the user. 
- The user enters a search term into a search bar, and the app fetches and displays relevant search results, including news articles and images. 
- The app is built using React and utilizes context to manage state and pass data between components. 
- The project is a good example of how to make API requests in a React app and how to structure components to keep the code organized and maintainable.
